# API LSB get similarity


In this repository have an API for get words similarity based on the Word2Vec algorithm using Spacy and the model in Spanish for get this word with a percentage of similarity.
the vocabulary is based in the modules  1 to 3 from LSB (language of sign bolivian)


## The algorithm word2vec

Word2vec is a group of related models that are used to produce word embeddings. These models are shallow, two-layer neural networks that are trained to reconstruct linguistic contexts of words. Word2vec takes as its input a large corpus of text and produces a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word in the corpus being assigned a corresponding vector in the space.

Word vectors are positioned in the vector space such that words that share common contexts in the corpus are located close to one another in the space
